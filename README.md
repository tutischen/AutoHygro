# AutoHygro - Automatic Watering System

## Description
**AutoHygro** is an innovative solution designed to help farmers automate the irrigation process, ensuring optimal water usage while maximizing crop yield. Using moisture sensors, a microcontroller, and a mobile app, the system allows farmers to monitor and control the watering of their fields remotely.

## Features
- **Real-time soil moisture monitoring**: Tracks soil moisture levels to ensure crops receive the right amount of water.
- **Mobile app control**: Enables farmers to control the system and receive notifications via a user-friendly mobile app.
- **Water conservation**: Only waters crops when necessary, preventing overwatering and reducing water waste.
- **Data logging**: Stores historical data on soil moisture and watering schedules for better irrigation management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- "AutoHygro Setup"
- A mobile device to install the app.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tutischen/AutoHygro
2. Install the necessary dependencies for the microcontroller (C++ code).
3. Set up the mobile app:
- Install the app from the store (or build it using Flutter if developing locally).
4. Configure the system:
- Calibrate the moisture sensors for your soil type.
- Set up the watering schedule through the mobile app.

### Usage
- Connect the sensors, microcontroller, and water pump to the soil and power source.
- Launch the mobile app to monitor moisture levels and control watering remotely.
